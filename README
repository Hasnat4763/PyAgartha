# PyAgartha

A lightweight web framework inspired by Flask.

## Installation

To install PyAgartha directly from the GitHub repository, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Hasnat4763/PyAgartha.git
```

## Usage

PyAgartha's functions and routing are similar to Flask.

There is a basic demo "TO DO List" app in the [Demo](example/todolist/) which you can check out.

Here is a simple "Hello World" example:
```python
from pyagartha import API

app = API()

@app.route("/")
def home(request, response):
    response.text = "Hello, World!"
```
